# <01-HTML-Git-CSS-Challenge>

## Description

This is my completed repository for the UC Berkeley eDX Bootcamp's challenge for Week 1: HTML-Git-CSS. I completed this challenge to show my understanding of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Git basic programming and semantics.

This repository displays the original, unsolved code and updates the HTML and CSS into a logical and condensed semantic structure, adds alt attributes to the project's images and icons, quality controls the links and titles, and adds comments to break down the updated CSS.

From this, I not only reinforced my knowledge of HTML/CSS/Git, but learned how to organize and consolidate basic mark-up code as well.
